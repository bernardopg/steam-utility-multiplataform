## Base parity

## Next
- [ ] Parse active user-specific Steam config where relevant
- [ ] Detect tool assignment precedence and edge cases
- [ ] Map compatdata entries back to app names in a richer report
- [ ] Add JSON schema stability notes / versioning
- [ ] Add tests for compatibility tool scanner
- [ ] Add tests for compatdata scanner
- [ ] Add logging / diagnostics mode
- [ ] Add release build instructions

## Later
- [ ] Consider Tauri or other GUI only after core parity is clearer
- [ ] Add CI pipeline
- [ ] Package binaries/releases

## Notes
- The repository now covers Linux discovery plus the upstream ownership/achievement/stat command surface.
- The remaining work is now in the `Next` items, mostly deeper discovery/reporting polish and auxiliary diagnostics.
