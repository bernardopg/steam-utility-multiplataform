## Base parity
- [x] Add a platform selector that chooses Linux or Windows services at runtime
- [x] Add Windows Steam root discovery
- [x] Add Windows `steamclient.dll` loading scaffold
- [x] Add Windows Steamworks native library resolution
- [x] Add Windows release artifacts to the publishing workflow
- [x] Update README and release notes for cross-platform support

## Confirmed remaining work for upstream parity confidence
- [x] Add deterministic CLI parity coverage for generic dispatch/help behavior plus the upstream commands `check_ownership` and `idle`
- [x] Add deterministic CLI parity coverage for `get_achievement_data`, including item lookup, aggregate output file generation, and initialization failures
- [x] Add deterministic CLI parity coverage for achievement mutations (`unlock_achievement`, `lock_achievement`, `toggle_achievement`, `unlock_all_achievements`, `lock_all_achievements`)
- [x] Add deterministic CLI parity coverage for stats mutations (`update_stats`, `reset_all_stats`)
- [x] Publish a Linux real-Steam validation checklist documenting the live manual verification flow for all upstream commands
- [x] Execute Linux integration validation for the native Steam paths (`steamclient.so`, `libsteam_api.so`) with a real running Steam session, because automated tests still do not prove the Steamworks command path end-to-end
- [x] Add Windows-specific automated or documented manual validation for `WindowsSteamLocator`, `WindowsSteamClientLibraryLoader`, and `WindowsSteamApiLibraryResolver`, which currently have no dedicated tests (`docs/WINDOWS_REAL_STEAM_VALIDATION.md`)
- [ ] Execute Windows integration validation for the native Steam command flow (`check_ownership`, `idle`, `get_achievement_data`, achievement mutations, stats mutations`) with a real running Steam session, mirroring the completed Linux live validation
- [x] Add deterministic coverage for `check_ownership` when no AppID payload is provided, including the default remote source path (`DEFAULT_GAMES_URL`) and failure handling for fetch/parse errors
- [x] Add coverage collection/reporting (for example Coverlet + CI artifact/public summary); this is now implemented, and the repository's direct validation path remains `dotnet run --project tests/SteamUtility.Tests`
- [x] Add regression tests for the remaining high-risk native services (`SteamworksSession`, `SteamOwnershipService`, `SteamApiNative`, `StatsSchemaLoader`) after the new CLI extraction coverage
- [x] Harden the release workflow / test harness around the custom test runner. (`TestRunner` now runs all tests and prints pass/fail totals; SGI stdout JSON contract tests added)

## Features
- [x] Multi-game idle: `idle <app_id1> [app_id2 ...]` spawns one child process per AppID (Steamworks allows only one AppID per process); each child emits its own init-result JSON line; parent relays them and waits until Ctrl+C or all children exit; single-game path unchanged

## Code quality fixes
- [x] Replace `SingleOrDefault` with `FirstOrDefault` in `KeyValue` indexer — prevents crash on VDF files with duplicate keys
- [x] Add Flatpak Steam path to `LinuxSteamLocator` — users with Flatpak Steam installation were getting `detect: not found`
- [x] Guard `SteamApiNative.EnsureLoaded` against partial init — library handle is now released and reset if any `GetExport` call fails
- [x] Extract `SteamPaths.ResolveSteamAppsPath` — eliminates duplicate private method between `SteamLibraryScanner` and `SteamCompatDataScanner`
- [x] Fix default library folder path in `SteamInstallationService` — was incorrectly passing `steamAppsPath` instead of `root` as the library path
- [x] Remove double-scan in `SteamStateReportService` — `ReportEntryCount` is now computed from already-collected data instead of calling `SteamCompatibilityReportService.Build` a second time
- [x] Decouple `StatsSchemaLoader` from `SteamworksSession.Current` — session is now passed explicitly to `LoadUserGameStatsSchema` and propagated to private loaders; `SteamworksSession.Current` removed
- [x] Fix `--app-id` CLI parsing — switched from `int.TryParse` to `uint.TryParse` to correctly accept the full Steam AppID range
- [x] Fix `SimpleVdfReader.TryReadString` escape handling — correctly counts consecutive backslashes before a quote so that `\\"` terminates the string while `\"` does not

## Later
- [ ] Consider Tauri or other GUI only after core parity is clearer

## Notes
- The upstream command surface from `zevnda/steam-utility` is present in this repository (`check_ownership`, `idle`, `get_achievement_data`, `unlock_achievement`, `lock_achievement`, `toggle_achievement`, `unlock_all_achievements`, `lock_all_achievements`, `update_stats`, `reset_all_stats`).
- This repository already goes beyond upstream with extra discovery/report commands such as `detect`, `libraries`, `apps`, `compatdata`, `compat-tools`, `compat-mapping`, `compat-report`, and `state-report`.
- The main parity gap is no longer missing commands; it is proof and validation: Windows-specific runtime coverage, Windows real-session validation, and release-workflow/test-harness hardening around the custom test runner.
